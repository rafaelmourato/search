## INTRO

This is Activity 0 from the course **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**.  
Instructors: Brian Yu and David J. Malan

### Summary

The goal of this activity is to recreate the Google homepage, the Google Image Search page, and the Advanced Search page, applying the knowledge acquired from the first few classes on HTML and CSS styling.

### Specifications

- [x] Your website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (**index.html**), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
- [x] On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right corner to go to the Image Search or Advanced Search pages. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right corner to go back to Google Search.
- [x] On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that query.
- [x] Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and placed beneath the search bar.
- [ ] On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that query.
- [ ] On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (based on Google’s own advanced search options).
- [ ] Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all text fields should be left-aligned.
- [ ] Consistent with Google’s design, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.
- [ ] When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.
- [ ] The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.
- [ ] Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s behavior, clicking this link should take the user directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
